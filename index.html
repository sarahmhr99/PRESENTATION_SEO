						<section>Introduction</section>
						<section>
							Due to multiple <b>misunderstood mental disorders</b>, I have decided to take this chance in order to hopefully  <b>make them more understandable</b> to the world and the people that will eventually stumble upon this website.
						</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Keywords and description presentation</section>
						<section>
							Having decided to work on <b>five different disorders</b>, it was only normal for me to reference them as keywords. But the consequences of those illnesses, such as <b>self-harm</b> and <b>suicide</b>, can't be neglected either, which is why I have decided to add them to the keywords. The last keyword is <b>psychiatry</b> due to the fact that mental disorders are listed in that field. 
						</section>
							<section>
								The catch phrase I imagined, <b>"For mental illnesses that are often misunderstood, because the human brain is a universe that is yet to be fully discovered."</b> is short and simple. The first part of the sentence speaks for itself, but the second part is a little more complicated. 
							</section>
								<section>
									Most people have their own little bubble in which they feel safer, but this particularly applies to people suffering of a mental disorder, in order to feel better about themselves and forget about their handicap. When writing the second part of the description, I also thought about how technology and the medical field are constantly evolving, but despite that fact, there is still a lot left to discover in those domains. 
								</section>

									<section>
										<b>The description:</b> "Get to learn about multiple mental disorders that are often misunderstood, such as depression, schizophrenia, autism and more. You will also learn, throughout this blog, the possible consequences of those disorders as well as what you may do to help."
									</section>
										
											<section>
											The description is merely the first part of the index, in order to show the general subject of the website.

					<section>Inspirations</section>
						<section>
							Since I associate a person's mind to a <b>universe</b> due to the fact that <b>each person is different</b> and it is simply impossible to know about every aspect of a person, I was inspired to use a <b>galaxy themed identity.</b>
